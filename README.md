# Vert_Calculator
Uses video framerate and time spent in the air (in frames) to calculate vertical jump.\\\

Calculations were made assuming the jump was done in a vacuum (no air resistance)

A few things to note when measuring vertical jump with frame counting:
1. Measurement will be most accurate with a jump that is straight up and down (limited horizontal movement)
2. Higher fps videos allow for more accurate calculations
3. Be consistent in the way you count frames (where you mark start and finish)
